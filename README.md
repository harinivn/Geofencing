# Geofencing
 
Geofencing can be used to develop an applications which provides new doors of opportunity for many businesses. It gives us a competitive edge that can help us to work more
effectively. The implementation of the project is done such a way that user’s device  gets notified along with vibration of device when enters a geofence area.


Step 1: Start
Step 2: Create a new project.
Step 3: Add libraries such as Dexter for request runtime permission, Location services for get current location device, Geo-Fire, Google map.  
Step 4: Remove activity_main and create new Google Map Activity.
Step 5: Create Google map API by creating a new project in google console and enable the “Google Map SDK for Android” in order to make sure API key  must work. 
Step 6: Run app and see Marker on Sydney.
Step 7: Request location of device and add marker on it where app can retrieve location of device and location to firebase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Step 8: Go to firebase and enable the TEST mode.
Step 9: Create the area that need to be set Geo-Fire and list the 3 area as dangerous area.
Step 10: Set location on Geo-Fire.
Step 11: Go to build run app after connecting the mobile to laptop through USB drive by enabling the developer options and USB debugging
Step 12: It takes some time to build sync and the app will be displayed in the mobile
Step 13:  App is ready.
Step 14: Exit the app.

Basically, developing the new system that replace the manual and older system that fully depend on request response system, which eventually not efficient in today technology 
environment. Geofences detect when someone comes in or leaves the given region
